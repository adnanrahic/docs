[Sematext](https://sematext.com/) is a full-stack observability tool that helps developers keep track of logs, metrics, infrastructure, and website performance.

This guide walks you through setting up synthetic uptime monitoring and testing for your <OrgName /> deployments. This is an agentless installation. All you need to do is sign up, create Monitors, and configure them to trigger URLs of either your APIs or websites.

You'll be able to debug and troubleshoot performance issues and end-user satisfaction with Web Vitals, Resource Timings, Waterfall charts showing slow-loading resources, pages, HTTP requests, and much more. You can also simulate business-critical user journeys with custom Puppeteer scripts.

## Step 1: Import and Deploy with <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

## Step 2: Install the Sematext Synthetics <NameWrapper name={ORG_NAME} /> Integration

With your project set up with <OrgName />, install the [Sematext Synthetics integration](/integrations/sematext-Synthetics) from the [<OrgName /> Integrations Marketplace](/integrations) to add it to your account.

## Step 4: Create a Synthetics App

When logged in to Sematext, select **Start Synthetic Monitoring**. This will set up a Synthetics App that acts as container for your data.

This will prompt you to set up Monitors to run tests against your APIs and websites. You configure conditions that need to be `true` for the Monitor to pass.

<Note>It may take a few seconds for metrics to come in.</Note>

By default, you get a set of reports out of the box, and will be alerted every time a Monitor fails.

These reports include structured formats for API and website performance metrics including web vitals, page loads, HTTP requests, resource load times, SSL expiry dates, and much more.

## Conclusion

This guide shows how to set up Sematext Synthetics for your <OrgName /> deployments. Synthetics will automatically run performance and uptime tests in a defined time interval you configure. It lets you debug and troubleshoot issues by filtering and grouping metrics from page loads, HTTP requests, web vitals, and resources, while displaying them on custom charts.
